Speak Easy is an iOS application being developed using SwiftUI that will allow users to easily convert PDF documents into speech. With Speak Easy, you can select PDFs from your local device or reference PDFs from URLs and have them read aloud to you.

## Features

- **PDF Selection**: Choose PDF files from your local device or reference PDFs from URLs.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert the contents of PDF documents into speech.
- **Customization**: Customize the reading speed, voice, and other speech settings.
- **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility by enabling users to listen to PDF content rather than read it visually.
- **Offline Support**: PDFs can be stored locally for offline access and speech conversion.

## Feedback

This was a sprint project; it took me less than a few days to conceptualize and code into existence. I made it to help me in my studies with reading some computer science papers while on the move. I'm always open to improving existing work and would love to hear your feedback. If you have any suggestions, feature requests, or encounter any issues while using the app, please don't hesitate to contact me at [kod3000@gmail.com](mailto:kod3000@gmail.com).

## Contribution

All contributions very welcome! I opened source this project in hopes to help others get a baseline on how to get an app up and running on iOS. I hope its useful, and if you want to add feel free to fork away. And remember, contribution is not only PRs and code, but any help with docs or helping other developers to solve issues are very appreciated! Thanks in advance!
